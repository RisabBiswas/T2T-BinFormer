# Effective Document Image Enhancement Using tokens-to-token Transformer Network
The official PyTorch code for the project "[Effective Document Image Enhancement Using tokens-to-token Transformer Network](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4354038)".

## Description
We propose to employ a Tokens-to-Token Transformer network for document image enhancement, a novel encoder-decoder architecture based on a tokens-to-token vision transformer.
